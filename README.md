# ImageRepo

Welcome to my ImageRepo! This poject was built with Ruby on Rails using the Devise gem for user authentication purposes.

I spent a lot of time with Ruby at Flatiron School, but never got the chance to use Devise so this was a great introductory
opportunity to dig in and give it a try.

I believe with more time the project would definitely function (and look) much better but for application challenge purposes, this is my submission.

Users may signin/signup and add or delete images. Refer to the seeds file for user signin data.
